          Ubuntu is one of the dozens of popular operating systems available on
          the market. Being a distribution of Linux, Ubuntu is an open-source
          operating system known for its improved privacy and security compared
          to Microsoft’s Windows. Ubuntu currently hosts over twenty-five
          million daily users. On the other hand, Windows is the largest
          operating system globally, dominating the market share with 1.3
          billion devices running Windows 10 and hosting over 91% of the world's
          desktop computers (Thomas, 2007). This study will investigate
          individuals with long-term Windows usage and their experience using
          the Ubuntu operating system for the first time, focusing on Ubuntu’s
          usability as a fully-fledged graphical operating system designed for
          daily use to gather an understanding of how Windows and alternatives
          compare. The reason behind this research topic is based on our prior
          experience using Ubuntu as computer science students, where we found
          Ubuntu to be a potentially viable alternative and became interested in
          its usability as a primary operating system for the general
          population.

        <h3>Background information on study</h3>
        <p class="main-text">
          Due to Ubuntu being a popular operating system in commercial
          environments, such as use for servers, this research's primary
          interest is based on the general population's usability of Ubuntu as a
          personal, fully-fledged graphical operating system, similar to
          Windows. With so many operating systems available, many of which are
          open source and free, interest was also taken to the different types
          available to consumers and why Microsoft Windows dominates the market
          share by such a considerable margin. Ubuntu stood out as a clear
          open-source alternative to Windows, known for its ease of use and
          welcoming appearance (Helmke et al., 2013), which led to Ubuntu
          becoming the primary basis for comparison, with further interest in
          long term Windows users opinions and transferability of skills when
          working with Ubuntu for the first time.

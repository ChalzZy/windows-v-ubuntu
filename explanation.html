        <h3>Observation Information</h3>
        <p class="main-text">
          Initially, an interview-based study was considered due to the
          effectiveness of completing the study virtually, though one worry was
          that the data might be biased, which creates inaccurate data.
          Blommaert (2010) explains that ethnography yields data that emphasises
          tradition, which may mean that data produced will be different from
          other data types (Blommaert, 2010). This may mean that ethnography
          would be a better research method for the investigation as it will
          produce broader results, giving a better understanding of the
          participants involved.<br /><br />
          Blommaert (2010) breaks up ethnographic research into three sequences.
          Sequences one, two and three being prior to research, during research
          and after the research, respectively (Blommarert, 2010). During
          sequence one, the researcher should create a set of questions to
          understand possible items to research. Sequence two involves
          perceiving what is happening and embracing rapidly changing patterns
          in data. Sequence three summarises data and supports any arguments
          made with the data collected. Blommaert explains it as "telling a
          story" (Blommaert, 2010).<br /><br />
          The unstructured nature of the ethnographic study is good for our
          research into the usage of Ubuntu. Though, our research does have a
          few physical restraints. Currently, due to the worldwide Covid-19
          pandemic, this research must be conducted online, limiting the number
          of participants involved. This may mean that the research cannot
          follow ethnography strictly and may have to include a mix of other
          methods such as interviewing.

        <h3>Research Information</h3>
        <p class="main-text">
          While undertaking research, various guidelines were followed to ensure
          all participants involved in the research were treated equally. All
          participants were given a participant information sheet before
          commencing the research activities. A consent form was also required
          to be signed to ensure that all participants understood the
          observation process.<br /><br />
          All participants were informed that their participation was completely
          voluntary and that withdrawal from the research was permitted at any
          time during the process. Once the findings have been finalised,
          however, removal of participant data may not be possible. Complete
          discretion will be used when analysing and providing participant data
          in the research report. Throughout the observation, the focus will
          primarily be on the technology itself and how it interacts with
          participants of various backgrounds, rather than focusing on
          participants and their individual set of skills. This promotes healthy
          observation where participants do not feel embarrassed for not
          completing a specific task; instead, this will be associated with poor
          design implementation on behalf of the operating system. There are no
          foreseen psychological or physical risks associated with this
          research.<br /><br />
          The data analysis method utilised for our research is a type of
          conversation analysis, where researchers are interested in capturing
          details on conversations naturally unfolding (Hesse-Biber & Leavy,
          2006). In the case of this research, participants will be asked to
          speak aloud on their thoughts while using the Ubuntu operating system,
          which will then be further analysed post-interview to gather in-depth
          information regarding their experience with Ubuntu.

        <h3>Method of Observation</h3>
        <p class="main-text">
          Initially, we planned our research based on interviewing our
          participants. We decided to follow the qualitative ethnographic study
          method, with a few modifications, given how broad our research is. The
          chosen method of study included participant observation combined with
          interview questions to get a further understanding of what the user
          was performing during a target 45-minute session.<br /><br />All
          participants are introduced with some initial questions: (a) "How long
          have you been using Microsoft Windows for? (b) What do you use
          Microsoft Windows for?” and (c) “Have you ever used another operating
          system?" These questions aim to help us understand the current
          expertise of each participant. The ideal participant is someone with
          extensive experience with Microsoft Windows but no experience in
          another operating system. <br /><br />The first five minutes of the
          research introduces participants to the Ubuntu operating system, where
          they are told to become acquainted with the system. During this time,
          the research will consist of pure observation. The aim is to give us
          an initial understanding of the participant's general knowledge of the
          software.<br /><br />To meet the time limit of the research,
          participants are prompted with three general tasks and asked to think
          aloud while completing the tasks. Each task is given once the previous
          task is completed. The tasks consist of (a) “Try to change your screen
          resolution.” (b) “Install your favourite browser”, and (c) “Change
          your desktop background picture”.<br /><br />The participants are
          given no advice or feedback when completing the tasks, as only
          observation will occur. This observation aims to see how participants
          navigate the unfamiliar operating system. When ending the research,
          participants are asked to provide a general statement on their
          experience and whether they would recommend it to another user,
          allowing us to see whether the user experience was good. The
          combination of ethnographic and prompt questions drives the research
          and allows us to collect significant data from just three participants
          within 45 minutes.

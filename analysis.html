          When participants were asked to complete the structured set of tasks,
          all were able to complete the tasks, with some caveats. When asked to
          change the resolution of the operating system, all were able to
          successfully navigate to the settings and change the resolution to
          1360x768. This may be attributed to the fact that changing the
          resolution is very similar to Windows and may mean that if a user has
          done it once in Windows, they can repeat it easily in Ubuntu. It is
          hard to state whether this is good usability design, as all
          participants state that they were successful due to prior
          knowledge.<br /><br />Secondly, when participants were asked to
          install their favourite browser, two out of the three participants
          struggled. Ubuntu requires installation files to be stored in
          permanent storage rather than temporary storage. Firefox, Ubuntu’s
          default browser, automatically installs executable files to Firefox’s
          temporary storage. This means attempting to install the software
          returns an error. The two participants eventually figured out this
          particular step after interfering with other tools such as the Ubuntu
          app installer, right-clicking different objects, and even pasting the
          error message: “Failed to install file: not supported”, into a chosen
          search engine. This task prompt took the longest out of all the tasks
          and may show that program installation in Ubuntu is not user friendly
          due to specific steps that are needed to take. Interestingly, once the
          task was over, the two participants who struggled with the task
          similarly explained that the process was unnecessarily complicated but
          now considered easy, as they now know what to do.<br /><br />The third
          task was completed similarly to task one. All participants were able
          to complete the task with no issues. The process of changing the
          background image on Ubuntu was very similar to Windows, and the
          comments made by the participants can confirm this. The general
          consensus was that this was a very user-friendly task.<br />

        <h3>Participants General Consensus on Ubuntu</h3>
        <p class="main-text">
          Alongside the research completed, we were also able to draw a general
          consensus from the comments made by the participants. Participants
          found the user interface to be quite intuitive and user-friendly. They
          also enjoyed the app drawer, with two participants commenting on how
          it is similar to a mobile phone, creating a familiar experience. At
          the start and end of the research, we explained what open-source was,
          and all users found that to be a particular positive. Most
          interestingly, the oldest participant stated that they would now
          rather prefer the software to be open source. Finally, participants
          generally agreed that their prior Windows experience played a role in
          understanding. One participant explained that someone with less
          computing experience might find Ubuntu jarring.
        </p>
        <h3>Recommendations</h3>
        <p class="main-text">
          Overall, Ubuntu has shown good usability for general tasks like
          browsing, installing applications, and altering minor settings. This
          research has not explored more complex tasks such as using the command
          prompt, as it would be outside the scope of the general user. Our
          biggest recommendation to the developers of Ubuntu would be to improve
          the installation process of applications. The generic user may not
          know how to debug error messages and may give up using an operating
          system if one was faced early in the experience. <br /><br />It is
          also recommended to continue to take advantage of the mobile-styled
          nature of some components in the operating system, as our participants
          found those features to be particularly usable and easy to understand.
          It would also create a more unique operating system, as many of our
          users continually compared Ubuntu to Windows and noted many
          similarities. However, they did not note anything unique other than
          the mobile-style app drawer.

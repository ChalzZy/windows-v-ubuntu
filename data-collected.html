        <h3>Data Collected Prior to Research</h3>
        <p class="main-text">
          Based on the data collected through observation, there are some clear
          discoveries common across multiple participants. Before the study
          started, we gathered general information on how participants used
          their Microsoft Windows computers.
        </p>
        <h5>Appendix A.</h5>
        <img
          src="public/how-participants-use-their-computer.png"
          class="img-fluid"
          alt="Responsive image"
        />
        <p class="main-text">
          As seen in Appendix A, we can see that all participants used their
          computers for general tasks such as internet browsing. One participant
          used their computer for tertiary studies. Another participant used
          their computer for work, whereas two out of the three users used their
          computer for recreational activities such as gaming.
        </p>
        <h5>Appendix B.</h5>
        <img
          src="public/prior-operating-systems.png"
          class="img-fluid"
          alt="Responsive image"
        />
        <p class="main-text">
          All participants had extensive experience using Microsoft Windows,
          though two out of three participants had limited MacOS experience (See
          Appendix B.). All participants had not used Linux or another operating
          system before, excluding mobile operating systems.
        </p>
        <h3>Observation Stage</h3>
        <p class="main-text">
          The observation stage took approximately 5-10 minutes and allowed
          participants to experiment with the operating system and become
          acquainted. Most of the participants had similar reactions to the
          operating system. Most felt that at face value, Ubuntu seemed similar
          to Windows. Two out of the three users explored the operating systems
          settings, preinstalled applications and browsing. The participant with
          the least technical operating system knowledge explored the
          preinstalled applications and navigated the many categories Linux uses
          to organise its file structure.

          In conclusion, the study successfully identified the initial usability
          of the Ubuntu operating system by long term Windows users. All
          participants had overall positive initial impressions when using
          Ubuntu and contributed their ease of use to prior experience based on
          their Windows usage. All participants experienced Ubuntu as a
          fully-fledged graphical operating system compared to its traditional
          commercial form and agreed that Ubuntu was a viable alternative with
          enough features to become an alternative to Windows.<br /><br />

          The main findings conclude that participants could successfully
          complete all assigned tasks, with one task proving to be slightly more
          complicated. This includes changing the resolution, installing Google
          Chrome and changing the background. Two of three participants
          experienced problems with the installing Google Chrome step, both of
          which were related to a difference in Ubuntuâ€™s installation process
          compared to Windows. The ease of changing the resolution and
          background can be linked to the fact that these two tasks are very
          similar to the Windows equivalent while installing an application such
          as Google Chrome differs. <br /><br />

          These findings prove further prove that prior Windows experience
          played a crucial role in the use of Ubuntu. <br /><br />

          In order to further this research, we would first increase the number
          of participants to understand users' experiences more and gain further
          insights and similarities between participants, as well and
          introducing more demographic variants to investigate how particular
          demographics display Ubuntu usability skills differently.<br /><br />
